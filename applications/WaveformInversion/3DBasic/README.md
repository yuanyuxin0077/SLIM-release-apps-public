##  PREREQUISITES
 All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided in the software  release repositories and should be installed as necessary before using  any of SINBAD's software.

##  INSTALLATION
###  Software in SLIM-release-comp repository
 Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the home directory of this software repository) to install the necessary components.

##  RUNNING

###  Preparing shell environment
 You must setup your shell environment according to the steps listed in  the README located in home directory of the software release.

###  Running applications/demos
Run the edam1.m script located in SLIM-release-apps/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBasic/examples to run a simple transmission FWI experiment to demonstrate the functionality of the new modeling code. The script SLIM-release-apps/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBasic/doc/example_publishInversion.m will generate the resulting html page with results

####  Hardware requirements
* This script was tested using Matlab 2014b with the parallel computing toolbox.
